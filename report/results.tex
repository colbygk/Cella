Results go here.

\subsection{Comparing \textit{r} = 2 and \textit{r} = 3}

In this section we compare the results of the GA for CA with r = 2 and r = 3.

\subsection{Mutational robustness}

In this section we consider whether our CAs exhibit mutational robustness as described in \cite{wagner_role_2012}.

\subsection{In search of a better CA}

In this section we try to extend the results.
