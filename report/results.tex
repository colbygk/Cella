\section{Results} \label{results}

For the results reported here, the CA population is 100, selection is tournament with elitism, offspring CA populations are created with both 
mutation and crossover, the IC length is 121, the size of the IC test set is 100, and unless otherwise noted, CAs are run for a maximum of 
200 iterations per IC over 50 generations. When rules are referred to using decimal notation, the encoding follows Mitchell 
\cite{Mitchell:1994:ECA:186092.186116} (rather than Wolfram). See section \ref{sec:methods} 
for full details.

\subsection{Comparing neighborhoods} \label{sec:2_1}
Our first goal was to compare rules with different neighborhoods. In particular, there is a tradeoff between the size of the search space and the 
the amount of information available for purposes of setting a location state. Larger neighborhoods have rules that can 'see' more of the source IC, and 
hence (intuitively) make a more informed decision about how to set the output bit, but this comes at a cost of increasing the size of the search space by multiple 
orders of magnitude ($2^{32}$ vs. $2^{128}$).

Figure~\ref{fig:waterfall} shows two typical CA runs on the same IC. Rule XXXX (left) has such-and-such properties, while rule YYYY is an example of a rule that successfully categorizes the IC within 200 iterations.

to the preceding row. The left hand figure depicts rule XXXX, which fails to converge within 200 iterations; the right hand figure depicts rule YYYY, 
which correctly categorizes the density of \texttt{1}s in the IC by converging to all \texttt{1}s.}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig:r2_rho} and \ref{fig:r3_rho} plot the performance of an elite $r = 2$ and an elite $r = 3$ rule, respectively, as evolved after 50 generations. As can be seen, performance did not differ significantly; or maybe it did. We'll find out, and put a summary regarding which rule performs better here.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{foo.png}
\caption{Performance of an elite, $r = 2$ rule as a function of $\rho$. Rule ZZZZ was tested against multiple ICs (when possible), and the precent correct is plotted on the \textit{y}-axis. As expected, the rule performs well when the proportion of \texttt{1}s is 
low or high, but performance drops as $\rho$ approaches the difficult cases around $\frac{1}{2}$.}
\label{fig:r2_rho}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure} [h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{foo.png}
\caption{Performance of an elite, $r = 3$ rule as a function of $\rho$. As in the case of an elite $r = 2$ rule (fig.~\ref{fig:r2_rho}), the rule performs well when the proportion of \texttt{1}s is 
low or high, but performance drops as $\rho$ approaches the difficult cases around $\frac{1}{2}$.}
\label{fig:r3_rho}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

It is also interesting to compare the performance of the most fit $r = 2$ and $r = 3$ rules over multiple generations. Figures~\ref{fig:r2_best_fit} and 
\ref{fig:r3_best_fit} show the best fitness for the two neighborhoods as a function of generation. As can be seen in those figures, both trajectories exhibit 
`epochs' as described by Mitchell \cite{Mitchell:1994:ECA:186092.186116}: There is an initial plateau interrupted by a jagged rise in best fitness, where 
these increases represent the discovery of new, dominant strategies. However, as can also be seen from the figures, the $r = 2$ population discovers later epochs sooner than the $r = 3$ population - or maybe they don't, or maybe it's the other way around.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{foo.png}
\caption{Best fitness for $r = 2$ CA by generation. The trajectory exhibits epochs in the sense that plateaus in best fitness are punctuated by moments 
where a new type of strategy is discovered, leading to a new plateau.}
\label{fig:r2_best_fit}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure} [h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{foo.png}
\caption{Best fitness for $r = 3$ CA by generation. As in the case of $r = 2$ (fig.~\ref{fig:r2_best_fit}), the trajectory exhibits epochs. In contrast to $r = 2$, 
however, it takes longer or shorter or whatever if we see any differences.}
\label{fig:r3_best_fit}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

As noted, the epochs depicted in figures~\ref{fig:r2_best_fit} and \ref{fig:r3_best_fit} correspond to different dominant strategies. As reported in 
\cite{Mitchell:1994:ECA:186092.186116}, these strategies begin simple and become more nuanced over time. initially, since 50\% of each test set of ICs 
has $\rho_0 > 0.5$ (see section~\ref{sec:methods}), a CA that goes to all \texttt{1}s or all \texttt{0}s will be right 50\% of the time, which is better than never converging in the first place. Consequently, early generations are dominated by rule that adopt this strategy. As the number of generations increases, 
rules retain the initial strategy of always converging one way or the other, but begin to include `extreme' values of $\rho_0$ at the other end of the spectrum. 
As the generations progress, the rules become more able to accommodate less extreme values of $\rho_0$.

Let $\lambda$ be the proportion of \texttt{1}s in the binary representation of a rule (section~\ref{sec:methods}). Then the transitions just described are 
equivalent to shifting from rules with $\lambda = 0$ or $\lambda = 1$ to rules with $\lambda \approx \frac{1}{2}$. This transition is depicted in 
figure~\ref{fig:histogram}.

\begin{figure} [p!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=7in]{foo.png}
\caption{Frequency of different rules (as represented by $\lambda$) by generation. Over 50 runs of the GA, $\lambda$ values were collected at every 
fifth generation. Early generations are dominated by $\lambda \approx 1.0$ and $\lambda \approx 0.0$ indicating that most rules converged on all 
\texttt{0}s or all \texttt{1}s, regardless of $rho_0$. By generation XXXXXX, .... yadda yadda yadda. THIS FIGURE IS GOING TO BE FULL PAGE}
\label{fig:histogram}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Finally, note that each application of a rule results in a \textit{transient} period in which a location state may continue to flip before finally settling to a 
stable state (if at all; see figure~\ref{fig:waterfall}). One way to quantify this period is simply to count the number of times a given location changes state 
over the 200 iterations of a rule given an initial condition. In order to visualize the relation between the length of a transient period and the fitness of a rule, 
we recorded the average length of the transients for each rule on each IC in the test set after each generation, and plotted this value against the fitness 
for that rule (figure~\ref{fig:transients}).

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{foo.png}
\caption{Average length of transients for each rule plotted against the fitness of that rule.}

\subsection{Mutational robustness} \label{sec:2_2}

In this section we consider whether our CAs exhibit mutational robustness as described in \cite{wagner_role_2012}.

\subsection{In search of a better CA} \label{sec:2_3}

In this section we try to extend the results.
