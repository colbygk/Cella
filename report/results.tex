\section{Results} \label{results}

Results go here.

\subsection{Comparing neighborhoods} \label{sec:2_1}

In this section we compare the results of the GA for CA with r = 2 and r = 3.

\subsection{Mutational robustness} \label{sec:2_2}

In this section we consider whether our CAs exhibit mutational robustness as described in \cite{wagner_role_2012}.

\subsection{In search of a better CA} \label{sec:2_3}

In this section we try to extend the results.
